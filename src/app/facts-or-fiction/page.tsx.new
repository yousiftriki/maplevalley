                  The beautiful, well-maintained buildings Maple Valley develops can help increase property values in several ways. First, our investments in underserved areas often spur further investments in the community. Next, providing workforce families access to stable, high-quality housing further spurs economic development as residents seek goods and services within communities. Lastly, it's important to understand that most of our residents already live in the communities where we build. In other words, we're generally not bringing new people to your community, we are ensuring your friends and neighbors have the best possible living situation.

                  Maple Valley creates stylish, attractive properties that are designed to fit the aesthetic and environment of the communities where they are built. We have won many awards for architecture/design, multifamily rehabilitation, energy efficiency, historic adaptive reuse, and community amenities. Our properties look as good or better than any market-rate apartment available in the neighborhood. Our leasing professionals often turn away individuals inquiring about our beautiful, well-kept communities because they are far beyond the income limits.

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                  Maple Valley utilizes a variety of funding sources and programs. This means that most of our housing is "income restricted" rather than "income based." Income based takes a predetermined percentage of a resident's income for rent. For example, if a person earned 50% of the median income, his/her rent would be 50% of the market rate. On the other hand, income restricted utilizes a range of income that is acceptable for residents. For example, we might only accept residents making between $20,000 â€“ $25,000 per year.

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                  Much of affordable rental housing developed today is made possible through Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC), a competitive public policy program enacted under the Tax Reform Act of 1986. This is Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code regulates and encourages developers to build affordable housing to meet the needs of local communities. In most cases, residents pay monthly rent without subsidies.
