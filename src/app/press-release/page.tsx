                In a unanimous vote, the Pontiac City Council approved the conditional rezoning of a vacant 2.56-acre parcel near Pontiac General Hospital. The rezoning changes the site's designation from P-1 (Vehicular Parking) to R-4 (Multiple-Family Residential), allowing for the development of a new 90-unit affordable housing community.

The Pontiac development is part of the company's broader mission to invest in communities through long-term, sustainable housing solutions.
